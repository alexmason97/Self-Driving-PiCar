# Self-Driving-PiCar
Welcome to the Self-Driving PiCar repository! This project aims to explore the exciting intersection of autonomous driving and Raspberry Pi technology. In this repository we will be developing a self-driving miniature car powered by a Raspberry Pi, integrating computer vision, machine learning, and robotics.
